# Slider-Game

This is currently an Intellij Scala project, the GUI is in src/slider/Slider.scala

Use WASD to move around the blue cube, left click on empty space to put down an obstacle that will help you get to the goal. The goal is to each the red cube and survive for as long as possible where eventually everything will be blocked by the obstacle you placed.
